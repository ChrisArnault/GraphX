- we have N objects
- we have P properties
- objects get some properties
- a link exists between two objects when the two objects share the same property

- we define zones : all properties associated with an object define a zone
- we can define a distance between zones:
  - number of properties NOT in common to the two zones
  - weighted by the number of total number of properties of the two zones

- we can compute the distance beween two objects = distance of their zones
- we can get all shortest neighbours of an object (out of its zone of course)
  - those are interesting neighbours
