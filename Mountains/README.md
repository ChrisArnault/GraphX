Generating mountains
--------------------

We generate mountains on a given space :
* location of muntains are random (peak)
* width and height = random

Generating objects
------------------

At every location of the space, the height (altitude) of the location is an inverse probability of the presence of objects.
We deduce that objects will concentrate in the valleys, and very few objects will exist on top of the mountains
